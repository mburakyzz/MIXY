Welcome to the Cryptocurrency Trading Algorithm using Binance API, Google Trends and Technical Indicators! This repository contains a Python script that utilizes the Binance API to trade cryptocurrencies based on a combination of sentiment analysis from Google Trends, trading volume and volatility.

The script uses Google Trends API to analyze the interest in certain cryptocurrency and based on the interest it will calculate the sentiment. It also uses Technical indicators like trading volume, volatility to make better trading decisions. Based on the sentiment and technical indicators, the script will then execute trades on the Binance exchange.

Please note that this algorithm is not able to beat the random walk strategy in the long run, meaning that it may not always result in profitable trades.

To use this script, you will need to have a Binance account and API keys. You will also need to have a Google API key for accessing Google Trends. You will also need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
pytrends
python-binance
websocket

It is important to conduct your own research and due diligence before making any financial decisions, and to not rely solely on this script for your trading decisions. This script is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be used as a primary source of financial advice.
